# boredom9key
9 key controller/macro keyboard with 30mm arcade buttons that I made, simply because I was bored!

Can play PIU/DDR/Pulsus/maimai if you want. 

4t plywood sandwhich with 3t acylic on the top!
It's built only for Aliexpress Chinese buttons, so other buttons wouldn't work due to height issues, unless you modify models to put more plywoods to make height higher.
